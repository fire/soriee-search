* Combining stable diffusion with semantic search to tag and query images at scale https://github.com/marqo-ai/marqo/blob/mainline/examples/StableDiffusion/hot-dog-100k.md 
* An open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing data https://datasette.io/
* "sorting" the vectors and creating a movie from these vectors accompanying images. Before we animate, we can make it more interesting as well by restricting the images we can search over by prefiltering on some of the scores we previously calculated. This effectively restricts the space we can use for the animation based on the filtering criteria.
